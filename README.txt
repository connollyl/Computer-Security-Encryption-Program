README


I was not sure which JDES.java you wanted in the zip, so the JDES outside of the project directory is the one
provided by you, and my JDES is in the project directory under src.
To change the file that is read in by the programs, if using Netbeans go to File->Project Properties->Run->Arguments
and change the 3rd arguement to a readable file, files which were used for the report results and testing
are named "testSize2.txt" where the number specifies the number of bytes. Provided files include
testSize2.txt, testSize4.txt, testSize8.txt, testSize16.txt, testSize32.txt, testSize64.txt, testSize128.txt,
testSize512.txt, testSize4096.txt, testSize32768.txt, testSize262144.txt, and testSize2047152.txt
